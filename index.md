  ## QUALIFIER 2024
  2nd International Workshop on Quality in Software Architecture \
  co-located with [ICSA 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2024)

excerpt: "QUALIFIER is a ICSA workshop on the quality of software architectures."
---

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.
On the basis of such specification, it is possible to infer quality aspects of the software to be built, like performance, reliability, and maintainability.
In fact, software architectures provide a valuable opportunity to assess and drive software quality from the early stages of software development, as well as later on, during software evolution.

The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners both from the software architecture and the wider software engineering communities to collaborate, share experiences, provide directions for future research, and to encourage the use of quality assessment techniques in any stage of the software engineering lifecycle.

##### Special Issue
<p style="background-color: #d0e2ff">
We are guest editing a special issue of the Journal of Systems and Software on the same themes of the workshop: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software/about/call-for-papers#quality-in-software-architecture">Quality in Software Architecture</a>. The deadline is on <strong>May 30, 2024</strong>, but we are already accepting submissions. Submissions will be processed and start the reviewing process as soon as they arrive, without waiting for the submission deadline.

## Call for paper

##### Themes and goals

Software architecture is a high-level abstraction of the system that, in stage-gate software development processes, provides a blueprint and directs implementation, balances various and potentially conflicting stakeholder concerns, and is influenced by high-level product requirements and business goals. For these reasons, software architectures must be of "high quality" due to their function. Quality itself is a broad concept with several meanings. For example, maintenance and performance are two quality properties that cover two distinct but related aspects of the same architecture. Therefore, we foster connecting researchers and practitioners to exchange knowledge on quality estimation in software architectures. Real-world contexts could benefit from the usage of software architectures, which in-turn could ease quality analysis of complex software systems.

##### Topics include, but are not limited to

 - Quantifiable models and metrics for SA quality
 - Interplay and trade-offs among quality properties
 - Refactoring and evolution of SA for quality
 - Automated optimization of SA with respect to quality properties
 - Quality of learning-based SA
 - Requirements engineering for SA quality assurance
 - Graphical visualization of quality properties of SA
 - User studies on quality aspects and quality assurance practices in SA
 - Datasets to benchmark quality assessment techniques for SA
 - Human-in-the-loop for the assessment and improvement of SA quality
 - Scalability and capacity planning
 - Quality-driven cloud computing and edge-cloud architectures
 - Quality aspects in microservices-based architectures
 - AI/ML techniques for SA quality
 - Software architectures and human quality of experience
 - Quality attributes for the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems architectures
 - Quality-oriented industrial software systems (such as I4.0 and I5.0)
 - Any other topic related to quality in SA

##### Submission

QUALIFIER24 seeks contributions in the form of:
- 8 pages for full research papers in IEEE format;
- 4 pages for short research papers in IEEE format;
- 2 pages for new ideas and emerging results in IEEE format.

All page limits include tables, figures, and references.

All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. 
All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EasyChair workshop website.
Submissions must follow the IEEE Computer Science proceedings format, as workshop proceedings will be published in ICSA 2024 Companion proceedings, and appear in IEEE Xplore Digital Library
