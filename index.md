  ## QUALIFIER 2024
  2nd International Workshop on Quality in Software Architecture \
  co-located with [ICSA 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2024)

excerpt: "QUALIFIER is a ICSA workshop on the quality of software architectures."
---

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.
On the basis of such specification, it is possible to infer quality aspects of the software to be built, like performance, reliability, and maintainability.
In fact, software architectures provide a valuable opportunity to assess and drive software quality from the early stages of software development, as well as later on, during software evolution.

The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners both from the software architecture and the wider software engineering communities to collaborate, share experiences, provide directions for future research, and to encourage the use of quality assessment techniques in any stage of the software engineering lifecycle.

##### Special Issue
<p style="background-color: #d0e2ff">
We are guest editing a special issue of the Journal of Systems and Software on the same themes of the workshop: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software/about/call-for-papers#quality-in-software-architecture">Quality in Software Architecture</a>. The deadline is on <strong>May 30, 2024</strong>, but we are already accepting submissions. Submissions will be processed and start the reviewing process as soon as they arrive, without waiting for the submission deadline.

__Title__ Evaluating Architectural Quality in the Cloud Era

__Abstract__

As software architecture continues to evolve, the methods used to assess its quality often lag behind. Traditional metrics such as coupling and cohesion are now gaining traction among practitioners, but their practical application remains murky. This often forces many to rely on intuition rather than structured assessment. In this keynote, we will explore the current methodologies for evaluating architectural quality and discuss potential barriers to their adoption by practitioners. Join us as we delve into the challenges and future directions in measuring the efficacy of software architectures in the cloud-centric world.

__Bio__

Davide Taibi is a full Professor at the University of Oulu. His research is mainly focused on cloud-native systems, where he is working on the identification and reduction of Technical debt, especially in the case of migration from monolithic to cloud-native applications. He is investigating processes, and techniques for developing Cloud Native applications, identifying cloud-native specific patterns and anti-patterns. Davide is also supporting local companies to keep their software maintenance under control, by applying continuous quality monitoring techniques and by supporting them in spotting DevOps antipatterns.

## Call for paper

##### Themes and goals

Software architecture is a high-level abstraction of the system that, in stage-gate software development processes, provides a blueprint and directs implementation, balances various and potentially conflicting stakeholder concerns, and is influenced by high-level product requirements and business goals. For these reasons, software architectures must be of "high quality" due to their function. Quality itself is a broad concept with several meanings. For example, maintenance and performance are two quality properties that cover two distinct but related aspects of the same architecture. Therefore, we foster connecting researchers and practitioners to exchange knowledge on quality estimation in software architectures. Real-world contexts could benefit from the usage of software architectures, which in-turn could ease quality analysis of complex software systems.

##### Topics include, but are not limited to

 - Quantifiable models and metrics for SA quality
 - Interplay and trade-offs among quality properties
 - Refactoring and evolution of SA for quality
 - Automated optimization of SA with respect to quality properties
 - Quality of learning-based SA
 - Requirements engineering for SA quality assurance
 - Graphical visualization of quality properties of SA
